    <h2>SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS ZERO WASTE</h2>
    <p>
      Sustainable living and zero-waste living are both lifestyle choices that aim to reduce environmental impact, but zero-waste living focuses more on reducing the amount of trash produced.
    </p>
    <h3>Sustainable Living</h3>
    <p>
      Involves making choices that are good for the environment, such as reducing resource use, eating locally, choosing organic options, and using clean energy sources. Sustainable living is a broader concept than zero-waste living, as it considers the entire impact of a person's choices on the environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Zero-waste Living</h3>
    <p>
      Involves creating as little waste as possible by avoiding single-use items, reusing, recycling, and composting. Zero-waste living also involves rethinking how products and materials are consumed and disposed of.

    <h2>HOW TO LIVE SUSTAINABLY</h2>
    <p>There numerous ways to live sustainable. Let us take a look at some of the ways so we can make a positive impact.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>GO VEGAN</th>
        <th>COMPOSTING</th>
        <th>RRRRs</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>You can start with going vegan if you want to help the environment and live sustainably. Do your part and persuade others as well! Now you may ask, how is going vegan good for the environment. Firstly, going vegan can reduce greenhouse gas emmisions. Secondly, it can conserve water resources. And lastly, it preserves marine life and ecosystems. </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Composting is a natural process that turns organic waste, like food scraps and yard clippings, into a nutrient-rich soil amendment called compost. Composting allows organic material to decompose with the help of microorganisms, fungi, and insects in a controlled environment. This process creates a dark, earthy material that can enrich soil, improve its structure, and help plants grow.</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Reduce,Recyle,Reuse and Recover. The 4Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover - is a simple way for us all to make a big impact. These four simple actions can help us keep our environment cleaner. Each ‘R’ offers a different way to manage waste. Together, they give us a comprehensive approach to waste management that maximises the use of resources and minimises waste. Follow all these rules and you can make a huge imact on the environment.</p>

    <h2>WHAT WE CAN DO</h2>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        <h3>Grow/Use local Produce</h3>
        <p>
          Local produce has less carbon footprint and is also aligned with the climate and needs of the people. It also supports the livelihood of the local farming community.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sustainable Transport</h3>
        <p>
          Use public transport or car pool. They leave far less carbon footprint. Also, a shift to electric vehicles and CNG based vehicles is better for the enivironment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
        <p>
          Reduce packaging, recycle, and compost organic waste to reduce waste and save money on disposal. So it is a step which gives a double benefit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Social Development and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Empower women and children, and improve the quality of life, education, and health care of families to help them escape poverty.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Practice Conservation</h3>
        <p>
          Conservation puts less strain on the environment. Also ethical consumerism is a big step towards this goal.
